    "We're going to try to determine **the probability that the first player wins a two-player game of Chutes and Ladders**, using the [classic Milton Bradley/Hasbro board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_ladders#/media/File:Cnl03.jpg). If we play a larger and larger number of games, the portion of all games that the first player has won should get closer and closer to this true probability. So let's start by doing that somewhat literally. We can write a computer program that simulates a two-player game and let it play a large number of games. We have a board with squares from 1 to 100, and we'll consider the starting position to be square 0. If a player ends their turn on square 100, they win.\n",

    "<div align=\"center\">\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "On each player's turn, they spin a random number between 1 and 6, and they try to move forward that many squares. If that would put them beyond square 100, they stay in the square they were in. Otherwise, they move to that new square, ignoring any chutes or ladders on squares in between. Before their turn ends, if that new square is the top of a chute, they move to the square at the chute's bottom. If the new square is the bottom of a ladder, they move to the square at the ladder's top. Let's also note that the players do not interact with each other in any way. They can pass over each other or end their turn on the same square the other is on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers are fast. We might be able to simulate 10,000 games in one second. So let's do that. How many did the first player win?\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "5116\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That passes some sanity checks — we expect the first player to have an advantage and therefore win more than half the time, but because it takes so many moves, maybe the advantage is very small. Let's run the 10,000-game simulation a few more times.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "5028, 5139, 5077, 5127, 5072, 5077, 5026, 4988, 5067, 5001\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmm. There's a good bit of variation there. It even dropped below 50% one time. If we want a very accurate estimate, we may have to simulate a very large number of games. One reason our simulation does not quickly give us precise results is that we are simulating one game at a time. Perhaps we can find a way to simulate many games at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine that instead of stopping the game when a player wins, we let the other player keep going until they also reach square 100. This does not change the result of the game (although it often makes that player feel better!). Now let's imagine that instead of alternating turns, we let each player take all their turns at once, for as many spins as it takes. When they're both done, we compare how many turns it took each player to reach square 100. If player two took fewer turns, player two wins, otherwise player one wins. This still does not change the result of the game versus our previous modification — both players spun as many times as it took to reach square 100, and the winner is the same as if they had alternated turns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us a new way to simulate a two-player game: simulate two one-player games and compare how many turns each took to reach square 100. But we don't have to simulate just two one-player games at a time. We can simulate a large number of one-player games, and then face them off against each other. If we simulate 10,000 one-player games, we can use the results to effectively simulate 10,000 * 10,000 = 100,000,000 two-player games!\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's simulate 10,000 one-player games and take a look at the results. The most common numbers of turns were 21 (280 games) and 23 (248 games). The fewest number of turns was 7 (15 games) and the largest number of turns was 213 (1 game). Let's sort these results by the number of turns.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can now face off each of these results against a copy of the same results. We'll measure player one across the top and player two down the left. Let's pick one of these matchups, let's say a result of 24 for player one and 80 for player two. Player one wins this matchup:\n",

As long as the two results took a different number of turns, player one wins one of the matchups and player two wins the other. Player one's advantage, and the only reason the answer isn't just 50%, is that if both players take the same number of turns, player one wins, and reflecting over the .

    "We can use these diagonal squares to describe how often player one wins. Player one wins everywhere below the diagonal and everywhere in the diagonal squares.

    "\n",
    "To make our diagonal squares estimate more accurate, we can try to find the exact probability that a one-player game ends in each number of moves, which will give us the exact size of each diagonal square. Let's start by thinking about where the player is at the start of the game. The probability that the player is on square 0 is 1, and the probability that the player is on any other square is 0. After the player's first move — note that there are ladders on squares 1 and 4 — there is a 1/6 chance that the player ends up on each of squares 2, 3, 5, 6, 14, and 38:\n",

    "For the player's second move, we have the starting probability that they were on each square — now zero for 0, and now 1/6 for 2, 3, 5, 6, 14, 38 — and we multiply this by 1/6 for each possible spin:\n",

    "We can repeat this for each turn. After move 7, we get our first arrivals on square 100. It turns out there are 438 ways to end up on square 100 after 7 turns, and in lowest terms that probability is 73/46,656. This is the length of the side of our first diagonal square!\n",
    "\n",
    "On move 8, we have new arrivals on square 100 totaling 205/46,656, which is the length of the second diagonal square. On move 9, 70,579/10,077,696. That denominator is starting to get a bit large, so before we continue, let's think about what conclusions we can draw so far.\n",

    "After move 9, we can say the exact probability is between 50.0035% and 98.7157%. This is not great! But as we keep adding more diagonal squares, these lower and upper bounds get much closer together. After move 100, the lower bound is 50.7791999% and the upper bound is 50.8324577%. After move 500 — which a computer can calculate in less than one minute — the bounds are so close that we know the exact probability, written as a percentage, starts with the digits 50.78027734609139%.
